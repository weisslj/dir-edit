dir-edit
========

Rename or remove files in a directory using an editor.

Motivation
----------

If you want to rename files in a directory, things get really cumbersome if:

- the name modifications are not easily automatable (e.g. spelling mistakes)
- file names contain spaces / special characters (when using a shell)
- you have to rename a lot of files (when using a GUI)
- you would need to use temporary files (e.g. ``mv a tmp ; mv b a ; mv tmp b``)
- etc.

This script launches a used-defined text editor with a temporary file, where
every line is a filename in the directory. This enables the user to rename
(edit a line) or delete (blank line) entries. After saving and exiting the
editor, the script checks the file for consistency, detects rename loops and
finally performs the changes.
